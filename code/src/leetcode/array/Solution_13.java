/*Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
        Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
        Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like.class
        Example 1:
        Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Output: 7
        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
        Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
        Example 3:

        Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

        Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
        Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
        engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.*/
